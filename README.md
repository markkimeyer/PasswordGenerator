# PasswordGenerator

The Password Genator creates a new, random password based off user requirements for  5 pieces of data: 1) length; 2) lower case letters; 3) upper case letters; 4) numbers; 5) symbols. To begin the process, click the 'Generate Password' button. First, the length is a validated prompt that must be an integer between 8 and 128. Then, the user confirms if they want to utilize letters, numbers, and symbols in the password. The user input is then verified and randomized. Finally, the password is written to the page. Clicking the 'Clear Password' button will refresh the page so a new, random, and secure password can be generated.
